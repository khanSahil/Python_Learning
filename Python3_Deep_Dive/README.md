All the Jupyter notebooks and Python source files I use in this course are downloadable within each corresponding lecture,  or are also available via the following GitHub repo:

Please make sure you are using Python 3.6 or above.



Also, I have a Python video blog with videos on a variety of Python related subjects here:

with content added regularly.

This is an intermediate to advanced Python course.

To have the full benefit of this course you should be comfortable with the basic Python language including:

variables and simple types such as str , bool , int  and float  types
for  and while  loops
if...else...  statements
defining functions (using the def  statement)
writing simple classes using the class  keyword and the __init__  function
using simple lists , tuples , dictionaries  and sets 


Any short introductory Python course will do, and I will recap some of the basics in Section 2 of this course. 



You should also be familiar, though not necessarily in Python, with general object oriented concepts such as classes, objects and inheritance.



You should also:

have Python 3.6 (or higher) installed on your system 
be able to write and run simple Python programs using either:
the command line, or
a favorite IDE (such as PyCharm), 
or Jupyter notebooks (which I use throughout this course so as to provide you fully annotated Python code samples).
